# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status
This is a new, empty project with only a basic directory structure. The project currently contains:
- `src/` directory (empty)

## Development Setup
No package manager or build system has been configured yet. Future development will require:
- Selecting a language/framework
- Setting up package management (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
- Configuring build tools and scripts
- Setting up testing framework

## Architecture
Project architecture is not yet defined. This will be updated as the codebase develops.

## Common Commands
No build, test, or development commands are available yet. These will be added once the project structure is established.
